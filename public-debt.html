<p><em>Romerskirchen</em></p>
<p>Already before the outset of the global pandemic, public debt loomed at historically high levels in all but a few advanced economies. The pandemic-related surge in government financing needs has resulted in OECD governments issuing a record amount of debt. Questions around the sustainability of this growing debt burden have taken centre stage in accounts of public finance. What is largely absent in these debates is the question of how governments actually borrow. The budgetary constraints of debt are not merely a function of debt levels, but are influenced by the ways in which public debt is planned, issued and managed. In the UK, 2019/20 debt interest payments, while benefiting from low interest rates, amounted to £48 billion – more than defence spending. In spite of its economic and political importance, public debt management has received scant attention and continues to be clouded with technocratic obscurity. The arcane nature of public debt management has allowed consequential reforms in debt management agencies to largely fly under public and academic radars. This ESRC-funded study seeks to give a comprehensive account of this overlooked revolution.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1980s, debt management functions in rich economies have been handed over to newly created debt management offices, which now enjoy far-reaching policy independence in managing sovereign debt. Who are these agencies which manage over 50 trillion US-Dollars across OECD countries? How can we explain the transformation of public debt management, both regarding institutional arrangements and new managerial practices? And what are the consequences and challenges of this silent revolution?</p>
<p>This project on the operational arm of debt management seeks to throw light into an overlooked corner of public finances. ToPDeM will theorise and analyse the diffusion of new practices in sovereign debt management. In so doing, this research will combine evidence from statistical analyses of 24 advanced economies with an in-depth comparative case study of 3 countries demonstrating variation in institutional outcome (the UK, Germany, and Denmark).</p>

<p><em>G30 Report</em></p>
<p><strong>Sovereign Debt and Financing for Recovery after the COVID-19 Shock: Next Steps to Build a Better Architecture</strong></p>
<p>This report acknowledges the world – and lower-income countries – have so far avoided large pandemic-driven debt defaults in part due to positive spillovers from extraordinary monetary and fiscal support in mature markets. However, the authors caution against complacency, warning that as the overall economic outlook brightens, the likelihood of tightening policy may result in outflows as well as further debt distress and ill effects in emerging and frontier market economies. Moreover, continued worries over the course of the pandemic, predominately vaccination rates and global access, must discourage early complacency or congratulatory posturing.</p>
<p>The report makes clear that collective aversion to crisis planning - ostensibly for fear of triggering a self-fulfilling prophesy of debt defaults - is irresponsible when much of the world is one unforeseen shock away from a lost decade. The report underscores that now is the time to rebuild and reform the architecture to improve its long-term resilience and effectiveness. The G30 report makes a series of important recommendations designed to buttress the sovereign debt restructuring process and mechanisms in the following areas: There should be a recycling of SDRs, creditors should reaffirm and elaborate the comparability of treatment principle, the G-20 should establish a standing consultative mechanism in conjunction with the Common Framework, national law in major financial markets should shield payment systems and intermediaries from disruptive debt collection, the G-20 should publicly disavow the use of contract terms that impair debtors or creditors participation in international debt negotiations, and commercial, official, and multilateral lenders should encourage sovereign borrowers to adopt robust domestic debt disclosure requirements as part of their debt authorization.</p>
<p>Slow progress on reforming debt architecture leaves the world unprepared to deal with persistent global public health and macroeconomic vulnerabilities in the coming years.</p>
<p>The ravages of the pandemic are now at the highest point in several important emerging markets, while higher inflation is resulting in policy tightening, endangering the economic recovery.</p>
<p>The possibility of debt servicing difficulties is substantial in the near term.</p>
<p>The mechanisms put in place so far are likely inadequate to the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>Continued failure to take the necessary steps to prepare for future shocks increases the risk that debt problems would not be resolved in an orderly way.</p>

<p>The system as a whole looks highly unstable. The Treasury market, “is primed so that high-frequency traders and primary dealers pull back when there are problems”, said Yesha Yadav, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School in Nashville who studies Treasury market structure and regulation. “The way this is set up is designed to fail. It is exceptionally fragile,” Yadav said.</p>
<p>Yadav has just put out a Columbia Law Review article on Treasury market structure and its fragilities which I highly recommend. The picture she paints is alarming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The asymmetric distribution of regulatory burdens between primary dealers on the one hand and high-speed securities firms on the other limits opportunities for private cooperation and mutually reinforces risk-taking behavior by both sets of players. Unwieldy public monitoring, combined with a light-touch rulebook, allows all firms to take risks or trade opportunistically with little chance of detection and discipline. Traders can also cheaply exit the market if something goes wrong, limiting how fully they must internalize the costs of their risky behavior. For the less-regulated, nonprimary dealer firms, the regulatory constraints are even weaker, further increasing their financial incentive to seek risk in Treasury markets. Faced with diminishing profits and a less lucrative franchise, primary dealers are also incentivized to take risks and shirk self-discipline. So, not only is the task of private oversight logistically harder as the number of traders proliferates and diversifies, but it is also problematic when self-policing would result in primary dealers imposing added costs on themselves in a period of fierce competition and lower profits. The consequences of this regulatory neglect in Treasury markets were apparent even prior to the March 2020 COVID-19 crisis, as a number of disruptions over the years pointed to unaddressed fragilities at the heart of this supposedly failure-proof market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regulators have discussed making changes to bolster Treasury market liquidity. There have been recommendations also from the G30.</p>
<p>But progress has been slow and the lack of a centralised Treasury market regulator can cause confusion.</p>
<p>Yadev’s first proposal for stabilization would be a binding Memorandum of Understanding between the regulators themselves to create a clearer division of labour between them.</p>
<p>Her second proposal takes up the suggestion from Darrel Duffie for a centralized Treasury clearing house model that would ensure that all major players had skin in the game in ensuring that the market continued to function even at moments of stress.</p>
<p>In the view of Bank of America analysts: “Treasury market size “has outgrown dealer ability to effectively intermediate risk.” This then requires an “official-sector role as dealer of last resort.””</p>

<p>The role of high frequency traders and hedge funds in 2020’s liquidity freeze has gotten a lot of attention. Much has especially been made of the increasing role of hedge funds. I haven’t historically focused on this topic because I’ve felt that it missed the more fundamental issues. The key is that before the international financial regulatory agreement Basel III, dealer balance sheets could expand to an unlimited extent in order to absorb “risk free” treasury securities. I wrote about this multiple times in 2020. Hedge funds, or high frequency traders, backing out of these markets during periods of instability didn’t seem to me to be particularly surprising. Nor did I think limiting the extent their balance sheets could expand to absorb treasuries would improve liquidity, even if it did make these institutions “safer”.</p>
<p>I don’t think any of those conclusions are wrong, but I’ve become convinced over the past six months that it is interesting in and of itself that these actors have stepped into the breach. Some have become referring to them as “shadow dealers”. A recent interesting paper on this comes from Columbia Law professor Lev Menand and New York Fed Senior Policy Advisor Josh Younger. They focus on the history and current state of the treasury market, with a special focus on repo financing of treasury holdings. Following a lot of the alternative monetary analysis of the last 15 years, they treat repo liabilities as a form of money. That means they come to the conclusion that the U.S. has never stopped “money financing” treasury holdings.</p>
<p>What changed after the Fed-Treasury Accord of 1951 was instead the type of money that financed their holdings and which institutions began holding them (and emitting money liabilities). In short, we went from central banks and banks purchasing and holding treasuries by issuing settlement balances or emitting bank deposits to dealers emitting repo liabilities. The paper, <a href="https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/CBLR/article/view/11900/6018?ref=crisesnotes.com">“Money and the Public Debt: Treasury Market Liquidity as a Legal Phenomenon”</a>, is well worth a read (and not just because it positively cites me multiple times, including making the argument the paper makes in 2020).</p>
<p>In reading this paper I have become convinced that I have <strong>underrated the role of these high frequency trading desks and hedge funds</strong>. The core issue is one of monetary design, but these institutions reflect that lack of monetary design. Rather than being sideshows, their behavior in recent years reflects the opportunity to partially take the place left behind by more rigid balance sheets of dealers, who remained part of bank holding companies. At the same time, since “shadow” dealers are further outside the reach of the “regulatory perimeter”, they don’t have the same obligations as licensed dealers. They don’t have to regularly participate in treasury markets, and provision liquidity. Nor do they have access to the backstops that licensed government securities dealers have.</p>
<p>These HFT desks and hedge funds run from treasury markets at the first sign of trouble, and that’s precisely what they did after SVB failed.</p>

<p><em>Menand and Younger Abstract</em></p>
<p>The market for U.S. government debt (Treasuries) forms the
bedrock of the global financial system. The ability of investors
to sell Treasuries quickly, cheaply, and at scale has led to an
assumption, in many places enshrined in law, that Treasuries
are nearly equivalent to cash. Yet in recent years Treasury
market liquidity has evaporated on several occasions and, in
2020, the market’s near collapse led to the most aggressive
central bank intervention in history.
This Article pieces together what went wrong and offers a
new account of the relationship between money issue and debt
issue as mechanisms of public finance. It argues that a high
degree of convertibility between Treasuries and cash generally
requires intermediaries that can augment the money supply,
absorbing sales by expanding their balance sheets on both
sides. The historical depth of the Treasury market was in large
part the result of a concerted effort by policymakers to nurture
and support such balance sheet capacity at a collection of
nonbank broker-dealers. In 2008, the ability of these
intermediaries to augment the money supply became impaired
as investors lost confidence in their money-like liabilities
(known as repos). Subsequent changes to market structure
pushed substantial Treasury dealing further beyond the bank
regulatory perimeter, leaving public finance increasingly
dependent on high-frequency traders and hedge funds—
“shadow dealers.” The near money issued by these
intermediaries proved highly unstable in 2020. Policy makers
are now focused on reforming Treasury market structure so
that Treasuries remain the world’s most liquid asset class.
Successful reform likely requires a legal framework that,
among other things, supports elastic intermediation capacity
through balance sheets that can expand and contract as needed
to meet market needs.</p>
<p><em>Menand and Younger Conclusion</em></p>
<p>From the start, the “breadth, depth, and resiliency” of
Treasury markets has turned on monetary system design.449
In the 1950s, Fed officials, relying on purchase and sale
transactions conducted under their §14 authority rather than
on loans extended under §13(3) or §13(13), created a new
market for financial instruments (repo) that looked quite
similar to, and in several important ways were more
attractive than, deposits and other money claims. By
providing a liquidity backstop at an administered rate and
(eventually) preferential treatment under the Bankruptcy
Code, policy makers attracted a broad and diverse group of
potential cash providers; regulation of its government
securities dealers under an investor protection framework
allowed for higher levels of leverage than would be allowed for
depository institutions. The result was a curious tension:
intermediating Treasury markets was important enough to
garner significant public sponsorship and support, but its
providers were not systemically important enough to be
subject to the same level of prudential oversight as banks. The
arrangement led the U.S. financial system down a path
towards increased reliance on shadow banking. While many
factors contributed to the GFC in 2008, it seems at least
plausible that Martin’s Fed set in motion a series of events
that contributed to what eventually transpired.</p>
<p>The 2010s offered a brief period during which dealer
activity was consolidated inside the banking perimeter. That,
however, did not ultimately last long in practice. New
regulatory requirements that assigned a cost to leverage
agnostic of risk once again pushed Treasury and repo
intermediation in the direction of non-banks. The players
were admittedly different—PTFs and other HFTs taking on
one aspect of market making (trade matching), and RV hedge
funds the other (inventory management)—they too relied on
easy access to cheap and available repo funding for their
activities. And once again, that system proved vulnerable to
shocks.</p>
<p>The present moment presents yet another opportunity for
reflection. It is also a critical phase in the financial history of
the U.S. and the dollar. The trajectory of mandatory federal
spending points to a secular widening of deficits over the
medium- to long-term. Ensuring markets keep pace with that
growth remains, as Chairman Martin observed back in 1959,
“obviously needed for the functioning of our financial
mechanism.”450 Absent reform, one possibility is another
panic. That is certainly one way to interpret the second
Treasury market functioning event of the post-Accord era: the
1958 funding squeeze, which bears some important
similarities to recent events.</p>
<p>A number of reforms have been proposed to reduce the risk
of that outcome. Most are aimed to some extent at giving
banks a greater role in that market, but they vary in intent
and effectiveness. An outstanding question for policy makers
is more of a first principles approach: should Treasury
intermediation occur inside, rather than outside, the banking
perimeter? To the extent that its systemic importance is
similar to that of the banking and monetary system more
broadly, as recent events and policy responses suggest,
locating intermediation within the banking system would
appear preferable. It would, however, come with costs,
particularly the extraordinary challenge of executing
fundamental changes in the market structure and demand
base for U.S. government debt. Although there are no easy
answers, there is value in clearly articulating the principles
and goals against which these costs and benefits will be
measured and weighed.</p>
